# Student-Id-Generator
By using Python Tkinter we had created a ID Generator which Generates a ID including Logo and a QR code which can  be scanned to get the mandatory details of ID card.

The output of the program is a image in the form of .png which contains all the details of the ID card


We created this by using some of the predefined modules in python like:

--> pillow    -    For working with Images we use this package.

--> os        -    We create a QR code which is saved onto the pc and later we delete it after pasting the QR code onto our .png image. 
                   To perform delete operation we reqire this package.
                   
--> datetime  -    To get the system date and time we use this package.

--> glob      -    As said earlier we gonna create a QR code and saved onto the pc. To search the saved QR code that exists in our directory we use this package.

--> tkinter   -    To work with GUI related components this package is mandatory.

TO EXECUTE THE CODE PLEASE INSTALL ALL THE PACKAGES WHICH ARE MISSING BY USNIG : pip install packagename
